# Rearrange-PDF-pages-accourding-to-desired-sequence

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a Python script that can help you rearrange the pages of your PDF files in a snap. Whether you're dealing with a large document or just want to reorder a few pages, this script can save you a lot of time and effort.

The script uses the PyPDF2 library, a popular PDF manipulation tool in the Python community. It reads in a source PDF file and rearranges its pages according to a desired sequence, which can be specified in a configuration file. The script can also delete pages or add blank ones if needed.

To use the script, simply clone the repository and run the main script file with Python. You can customize the configuration file to match your specific needs, such as changing the input and output file paths or adjusting the page sequence. The script is designed to be easy to understand and modify, so feel free to experiment with it and make it your own.

I hope this script proves useful to you and simplifies your PDF editing process. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding!
